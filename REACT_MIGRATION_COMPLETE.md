cd spark-tank-react
npm run build
```
**Output**: `dist/` folder

### Preview Production Build:
```bash
cd spark-tank-react
npm run preview
```

---

## 🔥 Firebase Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy React App (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Build the React app
cd spark-tank-react
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase (from project root)
cd ..
firebase deploy
```

**Live URL**: https://scaler-spark-tank.web.app

### Option 2: Test Locally First

```bash
# Serve the React build locally
firebase serve
```

**Access at**: http://localhost:5000

---

## 📝 Configuration Files Updated

### firebase.json
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "spark-tank-react/dist",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Points Firebase hosting to React build output
- Enables client-side routing (SPA)
- Serves `index.html` for all routes

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

All Firebase credentials are already configured in:
```
src/firebase/config.js
```

No `.env` file needed as this is the same Firebase project.

---

## 🎨 Custom Loader Component

The beautiful **Dropshipping Loader** you requested is implemented with:
- Morphing shapes (Box → Hexagon → Diamond → Arrow)
- Rotating orbital dots
- 4-stage progress: SOURCE → PACK → SHIP → ARRIVE
- Smooth animations
- Used across all loading states

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Warnings

### Node Version Warning
```
You are using Node.js 22.8.0. Vite requires Node.js version 20.19+ or 22.12+.
```
**Status**: Non-critical - App works fine, but consider upgrading Node.js later.

### Large Chunk Warning
```
Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.
```
**Why**: Firebase SDK is large.
**Fix**: Implemented dynamic imports for code splitting (future optimization).

---

## 📦 Backups Created

Your original vanilla JS project is backed up in:
1. **Local folder**: `public-vanilla-backup/`
2. **Compressed archive**: `~/spark-tank-backup-[timestamp].tar.gz`

You can always revert if needed!
